## The Site

LiveWires is held in the grounds of Chafyn Grove School. The school has great facilities, including tennis courts, a heated pool and a big playing field.

We do most of our technical activites in the school's classrooms and sleep in dorms. There are usually about 5 or 6 young people in each dorm.

Larger activities are held in the school hall or the dining hall, where we also have some very yummy meals.

## Finding the school

The school is easiest to find from the St Markâ€™s roundabout at the junction of the A36 ring road and the A30 London Road.

Take the exit for Bourne Avenue (Laverstock). It's the first exit after the A30.

Almost immediately turn sharp left; the school is directly in front of you.

You can see the school's location on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=SP1+1LR&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>; the school's postcode is SP1 1LR.
