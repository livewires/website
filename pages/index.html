    <h2>Choose coding, electronics, music&nbsp;or&nbsp;video</h2>
    <p>Build a technical project from scratch, with the tools used by professionals.
    <p>If you’ve never done this before, don’t worry: we’ll teach you everything you need to know. And you’ll take home what you’ve made to show off.

    <h2>Is there more to life than&nbsp;tech?</h2>
    <p>Dig into the Bible through short talks, chatting with new friends, and praying together. Ask questions about the Christian faith, and discover what really matters.
    <p>This year we’ll be taking you into Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, seeing more of God’s plan and purpose for his church.

    <p>We take time away from the computers every afternoon: jump in the pool, or chat by the sofa. You’ll end the day in a silly game with your dorm mates. And there’s the day out off-site…
