# A Day On LiveWires

The day starts with **wake up** - don't worry, we'll make sure you don't oversleep and miss the day! - followed by heading down to the dining room for breakfast.

We eat our **meals** all together - fantastic food provided by the wonderful team of kitchen volunteers! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are provided every day, along with drinks mid-morning, mid-afternoon, and before bed.

There are three times for **technical activities** (known simply as "tech") each day. These mostly happen in the school's classroom areas, but magically transformed with the vast amount of gear the LiveWires team bring and set up before the holiday starts. Most people will do two or three activities over the course of the holiday.

Each morning we all meet together for **The Link** - a time of learning about God and worshipping. This is no ordinary Sunday Service though: every morning there will be a mixture of things, including music with our fabulous band, games, videos, and all kinds of interactive and creative activities.

In the afternoon, we spread out around the site for **The Zone**. This is an opportunity to relax, play video games, swim, do some craft, enjoy the summer weather on the field, or just hang out on the sofas with friends. Each day there will be a range of different things you can dip in and out of.

After dinner, it's time for some chatting in smaller groups. We'll have a chance to think about God, home, school, family, and all the things that join them up, followed by some worship and time to respond.

Finally, in the evening there's **epilogue**, some time to chat about your day, play crazy games, ask questions and pray together. Then eventually it's time for lights out - ready to sleep so we can do it all again tomorrow...

A few of our days during the week have a different format: We'll have a day out mid-week to somewhere exciting nearby, and some changes on the last night, but you'll have to come on the holiday to find out what those will be this year!
