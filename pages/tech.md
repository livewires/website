<h1 class="page-title">Technical Activities</h1>

Here's everything you can try on LiveWires.

We'll teach you everything you need, and you'll take home what you make to show off.

You'll have time for two or three different activities. This page should help you choose!

<ul class="compact-links">

  <li><a href="#creative">Media Production</a></li>
  <li><a href="#electronics">Electronics</a></li>
</ul>



# Coding <a id="coding"></a>

Don't just learn to use computers, learn how to make them do whatever you want! Whether that's building an app, game or website, you can level up your skills!


<div class="columns">

<div>

## Games <a id="coding-games"></a>

Once you’ve got the basics of programming, you can build a game using JavaScript and our [games course](https://livewires.github.io/you-win/install). Create your own version of your favourite mobile game, or perhaps something entirely new.

# Electronics <a id="electronics"></a>

Pick up a soldering iron and build something physical!
Choose between loads of exciting projects, all carefully designed to make the most of your time with us.

<div class="columns columns-reverse">

## Learn to solder

All the projects require some soldering. Some also involve the making circuit boards and cases from scratch. But don’t worry, we’ve got the equipment and know-how to show you what you need to do!

</div>
</div>

<div class="columns">

<div>

There's a small extra cost for these activities, which we’ll tell you beforehand.

Each project has two difficulty ratings: the first for the electrical work (soldering and wiring) and the second for mechanical building (PCB, drilling, filing, nuts and bolts etc.).
