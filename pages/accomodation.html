  <h2>The Site</h2>
  <p>LiveWires is held in the grounds of Chafyn Grove School. The school has great facilities, including tennis courts, a heated pool and a big playing field.</p>

  <p>We do most of our technical activites in the school's classrooms and sleep in dorms. There are usually about 5 or 6 young people in each dorm.</p>

  <p>Larger activities are held in the school hall or the dining hall, where we also have some very yummy meals.</p>

    <h2>Finding the school</h2>
    <p>The school is easiest to find from the St Markâ€™s roundabout at the junction of the A36 ring road and the A30 London Road.</p>

    <p>Take the exit for Bourne Avenue (Laverstock). It's the first exit after the A30.</p>

    <p>Almost immediately turn sharp left; the school is directly in front of you.</p>

    <p>You can see the school's location on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=SP1+1LR&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr" target="_blank">google maps</a>; the school's postcode is SP1 1LR.</p>
