# LiveWires Data Processing Policy

This page explains what data we hold, why we hold it and how to correct it.

## What data do we hold and why?

We need to hold various items of data about you so that we can contact you and to help our planning, so you can have a great time at LiveWires. We hold contact information so we can get in touch and update you and to generate an address list of all those on LiveWires this year. We ask for information about your interests and church to help us get to know you better and to assign you to the most appropriate groups at LiveWires. We ask for preferences for the technical activities so you can do activities you would like to.

We also ask for you to complete a travel form so we know how you will be getting to us and so that we can collect you from the station, or contact you in case of difficulties in travelling. We also ask for a health form to be completed, so that we can provide medical care should it be required.

## What do we do with your data?

We store the contact data in our contact database. We delete the contact data after you are no longer old enough to attend LiveWires. It is accessible by members of the LiveWires leadership team and the applications secretary.

The health forms are stored electronically by a nominated member of the holiday leadership team and in paper form. These are securely stored at all times and destroyed after LiveWires.

The contact information given on the travel form is stored electronically by the leadership team and deleted after LiveWires ends.

We will use your email address to contact you with updates and information relating to LiveWires in the current year, or relating to the current year, including details about reunions, etc. We will also contact you after bookings open for the subsequent year to inform you of this.

We take some official photos of dorm groups and the whole camp which are stored for download by those who have attended LiveWires that year. There may be other photos taken around LiveWires of the activities happening which may be used by LiveWires or Scripture Union for promotional purposes. We request consent for this purpose prior to the holiday, and will not identify any individuals by name.

## Use of data on social media and the web

LiveWires has official social media channels on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. We also host this website. We do use photographs from LiveWires to update the LiveWires community and to promote LiveWires. When registering, you have the ability to grant permission for photographs of you to be used for either internal or public purposes. We do not tag people in photos and we will not sell any of our photos to third parties or use them for any commercial enterprise. We can not be held responsible for guests on LiveWires uploading content themselves, although we do discourage this. If you have any concerns about photographs being taken, please contact the leadership team.

## Who to contact if you want to correct your data

If you want to update the data we hold for you, please contact the holiday leaders by email at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#108;&#105;&#118;&#101;&#119;&#105;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#108;&#105;&#118;&#101;&#119;&#105;&#114;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#117;&#114;&#101;&#117;&#110;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a>. By booking through the Scripture Union website, they too will store details relating to your booking. Please refer to their data processing guidelines on their website if you have any queries or concerns.
