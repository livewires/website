## Choose from coding, electronics, music production and more!

Build a technical project from scratch, with the tools used by professionals.

We've got the knowledge and the gear to teach you everything you need to know. And you’ll take home what you've made to show off.

## Is there more to life than tech?

Dig into the Bible through short talks, chatting with new friends, and praying together. Ask questions about the Christian faith, and explore things that really matter.

## Take a break

We take time away from the computers every afternoon: jump in the pool, or chat by the sofa. You'll end the day in a silly game with your dorm mates. The food's amazing, and there's the day out off-site too!

# Get stuck in

We've got a range of technical activities on offer, learning the details for yourself or working on creative group projects.

We'll teach you everything you need, and you'll come away with something cool to show off!

* **3D Modelling:** Sculpt and animate a virtual model from your imagination using Blender.
* **Coding:** Write your own mobile game or app using Javascript. Or learn HTML or CSS to build a website.
* **Electronics:** Pick up a soldering iron and build a cool gadget. Choose between a macro keybaord, an escaping robot, an LED cube, and more.
* **Sound Production** Record, edit, and master a podcast or song with professional gear.
* **Video Production** Shoot and edit a short film or trailer, from storyboarding through to post-production.

# Where is it?

LiveWires is held in the grounds of a boarding school in Salisbury. The school has great facilities including tennis courts, a heated pool and a big playing field.

We do most of our technical activites in the school's classrooms and sleep in the dorms. There are usually about 5 or 6 young people in each dorm. Larger activities are held in the school hall or the dining hall, where we also enjoy the delicious meals.

The site is easily accessible by car, or if public transport is preferred we can collect from Salisbury train or coach stations. Arrival time is late afternoon, but if you arrive early there's plenty to see in the city centre.


# Meet the team

LiveWires is run by a team of about 30 volunteers,
including the overall leaders Joel & Roger.
