## Choose from coding, electronics, music production and more!

Build a technical project from scratch, with the tools used by professionals.

We've got the knowledge and the gear to teach you everything you need to know. And you’ll take home what you've made to show off.

## Is there more to life than tech?

Dig into the Bible through short talks, chatting with new friends, and praying together. Ask questions about the Christian faith, and explore things that really matter.

<!--<p>In 2022 we’ll be exploring the whole story of the Bible, seeing more of God’s plan for His people, living in His world, and experiencing His blessing.</p>-->

## Take a break

We take time away from the computers every afternoon: jump in the pool, or chat by the sofa. You'll end the day in a silly game with your dorm mates. The food's amazing, and there's the day out off-site too!

# Get stuck in

We've got a range of technical activities on offer, learning the details for yourself or working on creative group projects.

We'll teach you everything you need, and you'll come away with something cool to show off!

* **3D Modelling:** Sculpt and animate a virtual model from your imagination using Blender.
* **Coding:** Write your own mobile game or app using Javascript. Or learn HTML or CSS to build a website.
* **Electronics:** Pick up a soldering iron and build a cool gadget. Choose between a guitar pedal, an escaping robot, an LED cube, and more.
* **Sound Production** Record, edit, and master a podcast or song with professional gear.
* **Video Production** Shoot and edit a short film or trailer, from storyboarding through to post-production.
